# DIRT: Driver Initial Reconnaissance Tool [![](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/jthuraisamy/DIRT?branch=master&svg=true&passingText=Download)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/jthuraisamy/dirt/build/artifacts)

I'm writing this tool to learn C++ and get an initial assessment of drivers installed on a Windows system (e.g. master images developed by OEMs or enterprises). It's supposed to help with target selection, finding low-hanging fruit, and some assistance with deep-dive binary analysis. **Currently unstable, undergoing active development.**

## Primary Features

- [x] **Listing of kernel-mode drivers non-administrative users can interact with via DeviceIoControl.**
  - This can be useful to narrow down on drivers that can potentially be used toward LPE.
- [x] **Retrieval of company names associated with drivers to determine ownership.**
  - This can be useful in target selection to separate third-party drivers from Microsoft drivers.
- [x] **Resolution of the DispatchDeviceControl routine used to handle requests from DeviceIoControl.**
  - This makes it easier to find the function in IDA (versus relying on heuristics in static analysis).
  - The function can be analyzed to enumerate IOCTL codes and perform attack surface analysis.
- [ ] **Enumeration of the IOCTL codes supported by DispatchDeviceControl.**
  - There might be an opportunity for symbolic execution like [this](http://jackson.thuraisamy.me/pyexz3-hevd.html), but not sure how robust it can be.
- [ ] **Enumeration of user-mode drivers that make calls to a given kernel-mode driver.**

## Secondary Features

- [ ] CLI and GUI modes.
- [ ] Output formats: JSON, CSV, and human readable text.

## Alternative Tools

I've used a combination of DeviceTree, WinObjEx64, and WinDbg for these use-cases. It's more of a tedious manual process that doesn't scale easily, so DIRT just attempts to make it more convenient.

## Building

This should compile with Visual Studio 2015 or greater.

## Usage

1. Enable debug mode with `bcdedit -debug on` with an administrative Command Prompt.
2. Place [`kldbgdrv.sys`](https://github.com/hfiref0x/WinObjEx64/raw/master/Source/drvstore/kldbgdrv.sys) (found with WinDbg) in the same directory as `DIRT.exe`.
3. Run `DIRT.exe > output.txt` with administrative privileges.

The `--lp-only` and `--no-msft` switches can be used to filter results.

Below is some sample output to know what to expect:
